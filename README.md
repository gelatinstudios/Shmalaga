# Shmalaga

unfinished shmup written in C with SDL2

cpp/ contains the entire game re-written in C++ (ish)

if you compile this with make you have to create an obj directory.

i had no real reason to use make other than to try it out; i've never used it before.

there is no make install right now, sorry

just create a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin/ yourself if you want
something like this:
```
sudo ln -s ~/<whatever dir you put it in>/Shmalaga /usr/local/bin/Shmalaga
```
