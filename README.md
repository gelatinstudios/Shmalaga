# Shmalaga

unfinished shmup written in C with SDL2

cpp/ contains the entire game re-written in C++ (ish)

if you compile this with make you have to create an obj directory.

i had no real reason to use make other than to try it out; i've never used it before.

there is no make install right now, sorry


# todo

~~-make sound fx stereo based on position~~

-finish cpp version

-write a make install rule that actually works

# Bugs rn:

-stereo panning isn't working perfectly
